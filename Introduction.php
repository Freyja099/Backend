// * Session 1 : Introduction 

// * php is a general-purpose scripting language that is especially suited to web development.
// * It's used to build a dynamic web pages, it runs on a server not the user's web browser
// * It was released in 1995 and php was originally an acronym "for personal home page" but that was later changed to "php hypertext preprocessor"

// * How does PHP work?
// * The browser send a request to a server, PHP on that server processes that request then the server sends HTML back to the browser, the server running PHP can even communicate to a database using sql query 

// * To write php code we use <?php  code   ? >
// * To display a message we use echo either double quote or single quote and a semi colone at the end, that way : echo "message " ;
// * To add a line break we can use <br>

// * PHP file can contain HTML, CSS, JavaScript and php

echo "Hello World! <br>";
echo " this is another line";
